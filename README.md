## Try it out simply...

> ***I'll add more instructions about building the C++ binary later... #fromscratch***

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10.x and PyGame (*latest*) installed and added onto your `$PATH`.

2. Clone the repo using either of the following commands:

```bash
$ gh repo clone brian-ikiara/6utt3rd09 # if using GitHub CLI

-- OR --

$ git clone https://github.com/brian-ikiara/6utt3rd09.git # if using good old Git
```

3. Navigate into the new directory and execute the following:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
$ python3 ./main.py
```

4. Use the mouse and `WASD` key-bindings for movement around the basic map.

5. Enjoy! :tada:
